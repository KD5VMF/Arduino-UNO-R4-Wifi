# Pong Game on Arduino UNO R4 WiFi
This project implements a classic Pong game using an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi and an LED matrix. Two AI-controlled players continuously play against each other, with movement rules where each player can only move after the other player hits the ball.

The game will start slow, but it will speed up.
